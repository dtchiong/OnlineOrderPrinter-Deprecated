### About
This application provides T4 Milpitas an integrated interface to see all online orders from different services such as GrubHub and DoorDash, and allows these orders to be easily printed to labels with a click of a button. Therefore, not only does this app eliminate the possibility of human errors from workers having to maintain brain overhead from constantly switching between reading the order in the email that can span multiple pages, and entering the order in the POS machine, but also, this app significantly improves the efficiency of the store by allowing workers to immediately begin preparing the order.
